TimeOrg2Toggl.py is a simple script that reads a backup from the iOS
timetracking app TimeOrg, and dumps it in a csv format that matches what is
described in this post:

https://support.toggl.com/csv-import-new/

The idea is to use the generated csv to input it to Toggl.


The backup generated by TimeOrg is a sqllite3 database, and it has the
following tables:
   * times - which contains the user registered time track
         CREATE TABLE times (id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT, 
                             LoginTime DATETIME, 
                             LogoutTime DATETIME);
     We will mine this table, since we're mostly interested in this both
     LoginTime and LogoutTime.

   * settings - which contains some program preferences
         CREATE TABLE settings (key TEXT PRIMARY KEY, value TEXT);
     Settings don't contain information of intereste for toggle, so I'll ignore
     it from the migration.
   * times_statistic - generated with some statistics for easy use
         CREATE TABLE times_statistic (date DATE PRIMARY KEY, work INTEGER, pause INTEGER);
     The content of this table can be autogenerated from the previous with my
     settings in TimeOrg. In any case, it seems it does not translate to
     anything in toggle, so I'll just ignore this table too.
   * daily_tags - containing the labels associated to a certain date
         CREATE TABLE daily_tags (date DATE PRIMARY KEY, note TEXT, flags INTEGER, halfDay boolean);
     Finally, the daily_tags, although it could be interesting to preserve, I
     barely have used it, so I have decided to just skip it for the time being.

I have preferred not to include the backup database I have generated with
TimeOrg over the course of these years, but I have generated a simple sample
database that you can play with, for that just execute the script "generate_sample_db.sh":

$ ./generate_sample_db.sh

This will generate the file "sample-db.timeorg-backup", which it can be used to
generate a CSV file on the screen with using the TimeOrg2Toggl.py tool:

$ ./TimeOrg2Toggl.py -f sample-db.timeorg-backup
